These are updates that have occurred since October 2015. Previous changes were not recorded. 

1. Updated timestep to 2fs after running a timestep test. The README file on the test is under ~/README_TimeStep. (November 6th 2015)

2. Updated the script to include bond angles. (November 12th 2015)
        -The average values of the spring constants and the bending angles of the named alkanes (thesis_OLobanova), obtained from the fit to a Gaussian distribution function. The same intramolecular potentials (harmonic) are applied to describe all types of chain molecules (perfluoroalkane, semi-fluorinated, non-ionic surfactants). The details of the potential did not seem to be of importance according to work conducted by Muller et al. k(b)=7.583 kcal*mol-1*ang-2, k(a)= 2.650 kcal*mol-1*rad-2, angle = 158.6 degrees

.... Need to ...

Create database for file to include coarse-grained parameters for all measured chemistries - from group at imperial. 

Integrate pressure tensor test in the z-direction to account for oil/vacuum interface. 

Input file to include timestep.

Integrate timestep test as an optional output for a system.

How user friendly can this program be?
    Can only be used with LAMMPS
    Need to create potential tables for all beads.... probably easier to just read in parameters and let lammps calculate the intermolecular potential.
